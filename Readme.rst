One World One Education
=====================

	OpenCourseWare (OCW) is an educational initiative developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to make the core teaching materials for all MIT graduate and undergraduate classes available at no cost to Internet users around the world. MIT’sreasoning behind OCW was to "enhance human learning worldwide by the availability of a web of knowledge".The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects atYale, the University of Michigan, and the University of California Berkeley.
	
	This is an integrated online platform (portal) which suggests the most appropriate courses for the students based on specific requirements and preferences. The new site features a user friendly interface and availability of resources at a single point of contact. The main highlight of this system is a ranking algorithm that ranks the courses offered by different portals on the basis of user rating, panel reviews etc.
